The Markov chains can change the transition probabilities of other chains based on their current state, past states, location in space, or location in different types of social networks.
The states and state transitions can influence which social networks a person is a part of, and which Markov chains can influence them

The goal is to model social conflict, and let the user play with a realtime simulation and notice how biases arise, change, and interact.

We can also change how fast state transitions happen, based on anything.
User input has some lag, affected by the biases, which fight against the user, and show how biases can make a system hard to predict and influence.
